<h2>Final Project Revision</h2>
<p>There was alot of iterative work on this project so there  is not a huge difference between the projects. I was developing it alongside the progression of the class
  , I was using it for a D&D game I am running. The first draft is the state of the project when the assignemnt was announced in class, however most of the work had already been done
  by that point. Not many things different between the first and final drafts, namely adding the contact page, adjusting the footer, and adding a basic privacy notice as suggested by 
  my father. The link for the project will lead to a forking navigation page. I had built the project in a different repository to keep it from cluttering up the one meant for school.
  I was having problems moving the files around and rather than manually copy pasting everything over, I got the first and final drafts worked out and created a navigation page of
  sorts to lead to the individual projects. There are links back to the forking navigation page in the footer of each version, they are just meant for ease of navigation between
  first and final drafts. They would be removed in any sort of release build as the navigation page and first draft would not exist.
